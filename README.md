# Two Sided Marketplace for Sharing Outdoors Equipment and Adventure Vehicles
## Developed by Damon Johnson

### R7 - Problem Identification
As more and more jobs are becoming computer based, individuals often seek outdoor recreation and travel to achieve balance in their lives. The average full time worker in Australia has the right to four weeks of leave per year while the average full time worker in the United States has just 16 paid days of annual leave. We are living in a world where we are spending more time at work which makes our time off all the more precious. In order to seek out adventure in our limited time off we may need specialty equipment or vehicles to reach remote areas or simply have fun. Snowboarding isn't quite the same without a snowboard.

But if we are only spending a few weeks a year seeking out adventure, is it really worth investing in the latest gear and purpose built vehicles? These products can be highly expensive to purchase and maintain and are criminally under-utilised by the average consumer. Previously our options were limited. We either invested large sums of money to purchase expensive specialty equipment and vehicles that would be used just a couple of times a year before being placed back in the garage to collect dust or worse yet the outdoors would left largely unexplored and unenjoyed. 

My solution to this problem is a two sided marketplace for sharing outdoors equipment and adventure vehicles that I have named Flint. Currently there are established sharing platforms for individual item categories such as boats or caravans. Flint aims to be a marketplace that caters for all areas of outdoors adventure and recreation. By allowing users to share and borrow vehicles that will allow them to get to their end destination as well as the equipment they need to enjoy it once they arrive.


### R8 - Why Does the Problem Need Solving

By solving this problem, an application like Flint could forseeably have the following flow on effects:

*Sustainability*
Increasing the sharing of goods means that as society we are consuming less which has wide positive impacts on sustainability. This is an ever present and growing issues worldwide and can the most direct way consumers can impact sustainability is by reducing their personal level of consumption.

*A low cost alternative to adventure*
By provinging a simple and low cost way of hiring equipment and vehicles lowers the barrier of entry for lower income earners to enjoy the outdoors.

*Adventure Travel*
Users can travel to a location and then hire equipment at their destination rather than transporting equipment or vehicles long distances to be enjoyed.

*Income for Sharers*
Users that choose to share their own outdoors equipment and adventure vehicles can generate passive income for assets that are often severly underused. 

*Community*
Creates a positive community for people who enjoy the outdoors to meet like minded inviduals. In addition to sharing of equipment and vehicles Flint would look to become a community for sharing knowledge about the outdoors and a place for people to make connections.
